Bots for doing useful things in wikis.

**Pricebot** updates exchange rates and crude oil prices in a wiki. Read more about it at http://www.subsurfwiki.org/wiki/User:Pricebot

**Linknet** creates a DL file containing the edges in a graph of wiki pages, to show how they're linked. Visualize in Gephi.

**Catedit** edits the pages in a category.

Ideas welcome!

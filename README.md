Bots for doing useful things in wikis.

*Pricebot* updates exchange rates and crude oil prices in a wiki. Read more about it at http://www.subsurfwiki.org/wiki/User:Pricebot

*Linknet* creates a DL file containing the edges in a graph of wiki pages, to show how they're linked. Visualize in Gephi.

*Catedit* edits the pages in a category.

*Patrol* checks new pages for certain criteria and returns a reverse-ranked list of pages. In early development.

Ideas welcome!
